## üìå Latest Updates 04-10-2025
‚ö†Ô∏è Please Delete old monitoring agent (use option 3) and Install new agent (use option 2)

- New slot statistics notification system
  - Now statistics are updated directly in the message as live slots. Only one message instead of 25 messages
  - Support for multiple validators. Each validator has its own message with statuses
  - Fallback support. If an error occurs while updating the first message, the script will send a new message.
- Update in the installation script, new method of determining the IP address.
  - When installing a node on a server with a virtual machine, the IP address for P2P_IP was detected as local, which prevented the node from working correctly. If you have a VPN configured, specify the real IP address for P2P_IP manually.
- Update of the error file for detection by the critical error monitoring module
  - Added an error case when the node does not receive BLOB data from BEACON RPC

    - All settings are saved in the `.env-aztec-agent` file. You can change them if desired.
- Updated the cron-agent creation function with Telegram notifications ‚Äì now ChatID and Telegram token are saved in the `.env-aztec-agent` file and don‚Äôt need to be re-entered when removing/creating the cron-agent.

## üöÄ Using the Node Monitoring Agent

After running the script, select the option to `Install node monitoring agent with notifications`:

- Creates an agent at `~/aztec-monitor-agent`
- Set up a systemd service and timer (run every 37 seconds)
- Sends an initial status update to Telegram
- Continuously monitors the node and logs to `~/aztec-monitor-agent/agent.log`
- Sends Telegram alerts if:
   - The Aztec container is not found
   - There is a mismatch between the latest block in the logs and in the smart contract **> 3 blocks**
   - There is an RPC server issue
   - Critical errors found
   - Selected for committee
   - Statistics for each slot while validator to the committee (successful/missed attestation, proposed/mined/missed block)
- Clears the log file when it reaches 1 MB in size, saving the very first report.

### Requirements for Monitoring Agent:

1. Get a Telegram token from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Find your `chat_id` using [IDBot](https://t.me/myidbot)
3. Enter these in the script during cron-agent setup.
   The script validates both token and chat ID ‚Äî if entered incorrectly, you will see a warning.

### Updating the Monitoring Agent

If there is an update for the cron-agent, first update the entire script. Then delete the old agent and create a new one. The ChatID and Telegram token you previously entered are automatically assigned to the new agent.

## üöÄ Installing the Aztec node

To install the Aztec node, select **option 11** and follow the script instructions.
