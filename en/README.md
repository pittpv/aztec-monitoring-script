<summary>üìÖ Version History</summary>

### 29-07-2025
- Added the Aztec Node Update function. The function updates the node instantly without waiting for automatic updates from Watchtower.
    - Also use this option if you performed a downgrade and need to revert back.
    - Checks `docker-compose.yml` and replaces the tag with `latest`
- Added the Aztec Node Downgrade function. The function shows all node versions from Docker Hub, allowing rollback to any selected version from the list.
    - Selection of desired version
    - Updating the `docker-compose.yml` file
    - Stopping, downloading and launching containers

### 28-07-2025
- Updated the Aztec node installation script with Watchtower. During installation, the script will ask, "Do you want to run multiple validators? (y/n)"
    - Installation in multivalidator mode (up to 10 validators per node)
    - Installation in single-validator mode

### 21-07-2025
- Updated node launch command in CLI (validatorPrivateKey**s**) for node version 1.1.0 and above
- Added function to check for old screen sessions with node in CLI and delete them before creating a new session.
- Rollup contract address updated.

### 15-07-2025
- Improved the Telegram notification system **for validators**. Thanks for the idea @malbur187 (Discord)
    - When setting up the node monitoring cron agent, you can now choose which notifications to receive: only errors or also committee selection and block creation alerts.
    - The selection is saved in `.env-aztec-agent` and applied during subsequent agent recreations. To modify it, edit the `.env-aztec-agent` file.
- Added critical error detection. If a critical error is found in the node logs, a Telegram notification will be sent.
    - The error array is updated via a unified JSON file, allowing quick addition of new errors and their solutions.
- Updated the PeerID search function. Thanks for the idea @web3.creed (Discord)
    - After successful log detection, the PeerID is checked in the public database `aztec.nethermind.io`, and the result is displayed.
- Minor improvements

### 25-06-2025
- Added function "Stop Aztec Node Containers" ‚Äì a smart function that remembers your method of running the node container (docker-compose or CLI) and continues to operate in the selected mode.
    - When prompted for the working method, specify how your node is running: `docker-compose` or `CLI`
    - When prompted for the path to the docker-compose file, provide the path from the root directory in the format: `/root/aztec` or `./aztec`
    - All settings are saved in the `.env-aztec-agent` file. You can change them if desired.
- Added function "Start Aztec Node Containers" ‚Äì a smart function that uses the container running method assigned in the "Stop Aztec Node Containers" function (option 13).
    - If you **haven‚Äôt set** the container management method (option 13) and use the "Start Aztec Node Containers" function, it will work as a **wizard for starting a CLI node**. In this case, the script will prompt for the necessary CLI launch parameters, generate the command, and start the CLI node in a screen session.
    - All settings are saved in the `.env-aztec-agent` file. You can change them if desired.
- Updated the cron-agent creation function with Telegram notifications ‚Äì now ChatID and Telegram token are saved in the `.env-aztec-agent` file and don‚Äôt need to be re-entered when removing/creating the cron-agent.
- Added Aztec Node version check when the script loads.

### 22-06-2025  
- View Aztec logs function ‚Äì updated to show the last 500 lines with auto-refresh.  
- Check container and current block function - improved log reading and memory issue prevention
- Enhanced dependency check & installation for required script tools. 

### 06-06-2025

- Full localization, including the script and Telegram notifications, into three languages. Turkish language has been added.
- Added a function for installing the Aztec node with Docker and **Watchtower**. Watchtower is configured to automatically update the node container while preserving the configuration.
  - Installation of dependencies
  - Check for Docker and Docker Compose, and install them if necessary
  - Checking default port availability with the option to change ports if needed.
  - Installation of the latest node binary
  - Automatic creation of `.env` and `docker-compose` files
  - Opening ports in UFW
  - Starting the node and displaying the initial logs
- Added function to delete Aztec node 

### 05-06-2025
- Update for Watchtower compatibility

### 04-06-2025
- Improved block number search mechanism (Option 1 and cron agent) in debug-level logs. Supports debug, info (and likely all other) log levels. Maximally accurate search results.
- Enhanced block validation error handling
- Added a new option ‚Äì View node logs directly from the script (Ctrl+C to exit logs)
- Added block number output from logs when executing Option 1.
- Added script version control. If there are updates, the script will notify you about it.
- Minor improvements 

### 02-06-2025
- Updated log reading filter values for better compatibility with different versions of the Aztec node
- Added logging for RPC/cast errors
- Added script version logging

### 01-06-2025
- Improved compatibility. The script now works with both Docker-based and CLI Aztec nodes
- Added support for the new log format "block NNNN"
- Automatic check and installation of the `bc` utility for calculations in option 9
- Removal of ANSI codes before analysis for more reliable data parsing
- Fixed issue with PeerID detection in logs
- Optimized handling of block hex values
- Improved Telegram notification system


### 30-05-2025
- Added validator check function. Analyzes all validators, shows information for specific ones, displays full list.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Launch

1. **Requirements**:
   The script will check for required components and offer to install any that are missing.

2. **Launch or Update**:

   ```bash
   curl -o aztec-logs.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pittpv/aztec-monitoring-script/main/aztec-logs.sh && chmod +x aztec-logs.sh && ./aztec-logs.sh
   ```

   For future runs:

   ```bash
   cd $HOME && ./aztec-logs.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the instructions** to:

   * Select a language
   * Enter RPC URL
   * Configure the Telegram bot
   * Enable monitoring

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Main menu:

1. üîç Check container and blocks
2. ‚öôÔ∏è Install monitoring agent
3. üóëÔ∏è Remove monitoring agent
4. üè∑Ô∏è Find rollupAddress
5. üë• Find PeerID
6. üèõÔ∏è Find governanceProposerPayload
7. üîó Check Proven L2 Block *(the data that was previously required to obtain the Apprentice role in Discord)*
   - Now you can set your own port (default port 8080). The new port number will be saved in the environment file .env-aztec-agent
8. üîå Change RPC URL
9. üîç Search for validator and check status
10. View Aztec logs

## üöÄ Using the Cron Agent

After running the script, select the option to **Install the cron monitoring agent**:

- Creates an agent at `~/aztec-monitor-agent`
- Sets up a cron job
- Sends an initial status update to Telegram
- Continuously monitors the node and logs to `~/aztec-monitor-agent/agent.log`
- Sends Telegram alerts if:
   - The Aztec container is not found
   - There is a mismatch between the latest block in the logs and in the smart contract **> 3 blocks**
   - There is an RPC server issue
   - Critical errors found
   - Selected for committee
   - Created a block
- Clears the log file when it reaches 1 MB in size, saving the very first report.

### Requirements for Cron Agent:

1. Get a Telegram token from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Find your `chat_id` using [IDBot](https://t.me/myidbot)
3. Enter these in the script during cron-agent setup.
   The script validates both token and chat ID ‚Äî if entered incorrectly, you will see a warning.

### Updating the cron agent

If there is an update for the cron-agent, first update the entire script. Then delete the old agent and create a new one. The ChatID and Telegram token you previously entered are automatically assigned to the new agent.
